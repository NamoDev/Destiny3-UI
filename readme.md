# DestinyUI 3.0
The next-generation interface for Project Destiny - Triam Udom Suksa School's new student application system!

*Please note that this codebase (which was created to serve our needs back in ~2014) is no longer actively maintained or used, a bit of a mess, and released primarily for historical purposes.*

### Important Note
Destiny3-UI is *not compatible* with the old Destiny Core. It's completely rewritten from scratch and will only work with the new core service, Destiny3-Core.

### Ever get that feeling of déjà vu?
Yes, the code everywhere seems messy and repetitive. They're probably doing the same things over and over again. Best practices probably weren't observed in the rush...

`Note to team: please open an issue if you found any code that should be consolidated. Thanks!`
